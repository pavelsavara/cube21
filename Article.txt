  - shapes, different kinds of moves
  - cube model as permutation with repetitions
Algorithmization
  - Naive: remember all existing permutations, search them
  - Doable: index of permutation, way back to white cube
  - Only unique: normal shape, minimal cube, same results
  - Better: shapes, bib and small pieces, pages, tables of permutations
  - Paging: memory mapped file, fragmentation, half byte
  - Generating: fast code, rotate bits, CLR boundary
  - Disk crunching: orded work, prevent swaping, windows vista
  - Multi thread
  - Prefetch
  - Test
  - Client
